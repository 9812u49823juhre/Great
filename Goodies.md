### Overview 

[Repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies)

For some 0-click we don't use any source but ourselves :). These range from [cheat sheets](http://duckduckgo.com/?q=html+chars) to [tools](http://duckduckgo.com/?q=pw) to [info](http://duckduckgo.com/?q=%23564). 

Cheat sheets can be an external HTML file we call via an iFrame, but the processing goodies are written in Perl since they get inserted into our core processing engine. Often there are existing Perl modules that will do things, which are ripe for Goodies. 

There are lots of Goodie ideas out there, and we maintain a [request list](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/REQUESTS.md). Feel free to bring your own!

### Getting started

To get started in this category, check out the [Readme](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/README.md) in the [Goodies repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies). It explains how to organize your project, and then you can do a pull request and ultimately become a collaborator.

Feel free to edit this page and add to the above list if you have other source ideas or if you start working on one.
