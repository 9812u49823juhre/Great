Goodies are Perl blocks that we insert into our main processing engine. These range from [cheat sheets](http://duckduckgo.com/?q=public+dans) to [tools](http://duckduckgo.com/?q=passphrase+4) to [info](http://duckduckgo.com/?q=this+or+that+or+other). They are colored yellow on [the Trello board](https://trello.com/board/duckduckgo-open-source-plugins/4f08e96d947729b526070890). 

## Getting started

To get started programming Goodies, check out the [Readme](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/README.md) in the [Goodies repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies). It explains how to organize your project, and then you can do a pull request and ultimately become a collaborator.
