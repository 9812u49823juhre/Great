We hope you'll join us in making [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) the best search engine out there! A rapidly growing portion of our codebase is [open source](http://github.com/duckduckgo/), and we'd welcome your contributions.

## What to work on

 * [DuckDuckHack](http://duckduckhack.com), a platform to create instant answer plugins.
 * Our [Community Platform](http://github.com/duckduckgo/community-platform) (live at [duck.co](https://duck.co)), e.g. making a better forum, URL shortener, etc.
 * API helper libraries. More libraries (in your favorite language) to use our [Zero-click Info API](http://api.duckduckgo.com/).
 * Browser extensions: [mrshu](https://github.com/mrshu) is currently leading the effort for [Firefox](https://github.com/duckduckgo/firefox-zeroclickinfo) and [Chrome](https://github.com/duckduckgo/chrome-zeroclickinfo).
