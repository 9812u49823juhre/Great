We hope you'll join us in making DuckDuckGo the best search engine out there! A growing portion of our codebase is [open source](http://github.com/duckduckgo/), and we'd welcome your contributions.

# What to work on

 * [Zero-click Plugins](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/wiki/Zero-click-Info-Plugins), which is really anything that provides an instant answer.
 * Browser extensions, especially [Firefox](https://github.com/duckduckgo/firefox-zeroclickinfo) and [Opera](https://github.com/duckduckgo/opera-zeroclickinfo).
 * API helper libraries. More libraries (in your favorite language) to use our [0-click API](http://api.duckduckgo.com/).
 * On our [Community Platform](http://github.com/duckduckgo/community-platform), e.g. making a better forum, URL shotener, etc.
