# What to work on

In addition to the Zero-click Plugins, there are other open source areas where we could use help.

 * Browser extensions, especially [Firefox](https://github.com/duckduckgo/firefox-zeroclickinfo) and [Opera](https://github.com/duckduckgo/opera-zeroclickinfo).
 * API helper libraries. More libraries (in your favorite language) to use our [0-click API](http://api.duckduckgo.com/).
 * On our [Community Platform](http://github.com/duckduckgo/community-platform), e.g. making a better forum, URL shotener, etc.
