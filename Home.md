## How-to help develop DuckDuckGo

### Overview 

A lot of people ask if they can help develop DuckDuckGo? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes! But how, exactly?  This working document attempts to answer that question.

First, know that we have way more to do than we can handle internally. So any help is greatly appreciated. Chances are anything you do will eventually go live and so it is pretty easy to have a real impact on the search engine. It also relatively easy to influence the parts you personally care about, e.g. define instant answers for the types of queries you find yourself doing.

Much of DuckDuckGo is closed source, but a growing portion is [open](http://github.com/duckduckgo). We don't think it is right to ask volunteers to contribute to closed source, so what we propose here will also be open.

In any case, you can reach us at open@duckduckgo.com. We're happy to answer your questions, or help you figure out something useful to work on. We would like to ensure the shortest path to making what you want to develop go live.


### Zero-click Info

The main area where we could use your help is **Zero-click Info.** That's the stuff that appears above the traditional links and provides instant answers, topic summaries, etc. Basically, we want more of it and we want what we have to be much better!

You may have a particular niche type of search you like to do, e.g. electronics parts or program documentation, and you may have great ideas for the right 0-click source and information we should be displaying for that niche. If so, that's awesome. Work on that! We'd love to support you in that effort.

Otherwise, we are maintaining a list of requests that we know would make good improvements and are instant projects to work on. These fall into the categories listed below.

* **[Fathead](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/wiki/Fathead)**

* **[Spice](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/wiki/Spice)**

* **[Goodies](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/wiki/Goodies)**


### Other open stuff

In addition to the 0-click stuff, there are other things that are open that might spark your interest.

 * Browser extensions. We could really use help here -- please contact us for details.
 * API helper libraries. More libraries (in your favorite language) to use our [0-click API](http://api.duckduckgo.com/).
 * Logos. We'd love [more logos](http://duckduckgo.com/logos.html) for various holidays. We have [a repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/logos) that contains base source files. To make this really easy, just make the logo [the right size](http://duckduckgo.com/nduck.v104.png) (with the words - 200x132) so we can use them as a drop-in replacement. You can post logo ideas at [duck.co](https://duck.co/) for feedback.
 * We are also developing a [community platform](http://github.com/duckduckgo/community-platform), more information about helping there you get in [this thread](https://duck.co/topic/duckduckgo-community-and-42).
