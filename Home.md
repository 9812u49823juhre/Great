We hope you'll join us in making DuckDuckGo the best search engine out there! A rapidly growing portion of our codebase is [open source](http://github.com/duckduckgo/), and we'd welcome your contributions.

## What to work on

 * [Zero-click Info Plugins](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/wiki/Open-Source-Plugin-Tutorial), which include anything that provides instant answers.
 * Browser extensions, especially [Firefox](https://github.com/duckduckgo/firefox-zeroclickinfo) and [Opera](https://github.com/duckduckgo/opera-zeroclickinfo).
 * API helper libraries. More libraries (in your favorite language) to use our [Zero-click Info API](http://api.duckduckgo.com/).
 * Our [Community Platform](http://github.com/duckduckgo/community-platform), e.g. making a better forum, URL shortener, etc.
