# Contributing to DuckDuckGo

## Welcome as new contributor

We hope you'll join us in making DuckDuckGo the best search engine out there! A rapidly growing portion of our codebase is [open source](http://github.com/duckduckgo/), and we'd welcome your contributions.

## Where you can contribute?

 * The [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) [Zero-click Info](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/wiki/ZeroClickInfo)
 
The Zero-click Info is the most famous feature of our search engine. Here you have unlimited options to contribute via your favorite language, so far we support Perl, Python, Ruby, NodeJS and JavaScript contributions (depending on the specific component where you contribute), but we are open for more languages, if you help us setting up the base infrastructure.

 * [Browser extensions](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/wiki/BrowserExtensions) for [Firefox](https://github.com/duckduckgo/firefox-zeroclickinfo), [Opera](https://github.com/duckduckgo/opera-zeroclickinfo) and other browsers.
 
Many features of DuckDuckGo can be integrated into browsers, for this we like to see more extensions which make this happen. For now the most common integration is using the [Zero-click Info API](https://duckduckgo.com/api.html) as autocomplete helper, when you start giving a search term into your query window.
 
 * [API helper libraries](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/wiki/ZeroClickInfoAPI) for our [Zero-click Info API](https://duckduckgo.com/api.html).
 
We like that people use our API, but even if its so simple, people like to use it in their famous language. So far we have implementations in [Perl](https://github.com/Getty/p5-www-duckduckgo), as [Perl Application](https://github.com/Getty/p5-app-duckduckgo), in [PHP](https://github.com/duckduckgo/php5-duckduckgo) and other languages maintained outside our GitHub repositories. We like to help and support you supplying a new one in your favorite language.
 
 * Our [Community Platform](http://github.com/duckduckgo/community-platform/wiki)
 
In our ongoing afford to get in touch with the community, we started our own community platform, to offer more services for authenticated users, like also the option to help us on translating DuckDuckGo (and other projects) into other languages. As it being a community project, you all can help adding more functionality into the platform, and so let it be whatever you think the community could need :). Talk with us about, what you wanna do. Its very easy to run an own instance of the community platform at home, to test and play directly with the code, its really easy and a good start to dive into contribution to a bigger project. We still encourage you to write Zero-click Info plugins more, cause those features are accessed by all users, not only by the smaller group of community users.
