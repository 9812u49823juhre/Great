Spice plugins are JavaScript blocks that process data from JSONP APIs. They are perfect for Zero-click Info that changes a lot, e.g. [Twitter](https://duckduckgo.com/%40duckduckgo), or which requires a lot of on-the-fly processing, e.g. [cost of living](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cost+of+living+autin+philadelphia). They are colored purple on [the Trello board](https://trello.com/board/duckduckgo-open-source-plugins/4f08e96d947729b526070890).
