Fathead plugins create data files (in any language). We call them Fathead because they deal with the "fat head" of the query space and are essentially a [keyword mapping](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=border-width) (though with [some fuzziness](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=borderwidth+css) around the edges). They are colored orange on [the Trello board](https://trello.com/board/duckduckgo-open-source-plugins/4f08e96d947729b526070890).

### Getting started

To get started in this category, check out the [Readme](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/blob/master/README.md) in the [Fathead Repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead). It explains how to organize your project, and then you can do a pull request and ultimately become a collaborator.
