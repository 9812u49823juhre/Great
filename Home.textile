h3. Public TODO

These are some things that we could use some help with, which we are happy to open source. If you want to contribute but are interested in something else, whatever you are interested in will probably work too -- just let us know.

* *New lyrics providers.* Our current 0-click lyrics are from LyricsMode, but their site is too spammy (too many pop-ups). We choose them because they were comprehensive, so a replacement would likely need to scrape a few places. The current scraper and processor are in this repository: https://github.com/duckduckgo/lyrics Also see this forum thread: http://duck.co/#topic/28469000000511127 

* *Wikipedia lists.* We currently don't do anything with Wikipedia articles of the form **List of x**. Ideally we would turn them into category pages like https://duckduckgo.com/?q=the+simpsons+characters but we would need some generalized code to parse out the list members.

* *0-click scrapers.*
** **ISO codes* 
** **Macupdate**
** **Iusethis**
** **alternative-to** (API might be better)

* *Holiday logos.* We'd love more logos for various holidays. Repository source files: https://github.com/duckduckgo/logos. Past logos are here: https://duckduckgo.com/logos.html. To make this really easy, make the logo the right size (with the words) so we can use it as a drop-in replacement.

* *WolframAlpha regex improvements.* Finding more things to surface via WolframAlpha. Repository: https://github.com/duckduckgo/walpha that is a snapshot of https://duckduckgo.com/walpha.html

* *Dark theme.* People really want a dark theme.

* *Setting collections.* Exploring groups of settings that make sense (as a group). Then we can surface these as "themes."

* *API libaries.* More libraries (in your favorite language) to use our 0-click API: https://duckduckgo.com/api.html
